I replicated and then further tuned the parameters of a Machine Learning model in a Kaggle Project on COVID-19/SARS B-cell Epitope Prediction

Description:  B-cells inducing antigen-specific immune responses in vivo produce large amounts of antigen-specific antibodies by recognizing the subregions (epitope regions) of antigen proteins. They can inhibit their functioning by binding antibodies to antigen proteins. Predicting epitope regions is beneficial for the design and development of vaccines aimed at inducing antigen-specific antibody production. However, prediction accuracy requires improvement.
 
The conventional epitope region prediction methods have focused only on the target sequence in the amino acid sequences of an entire antigen protein and have not thoroughly considered its sequence and features as a whole. The work here uses a deep learning method based on short-term memory with an attention mechanism to consider the characteristics of a whole antigen protein in addition to the target sequence. The proposed method achieves
better accuracy compared with the conventional method in the experimental prediction of epitope regions using the data from the immune epitope database.
 
A simple dataset for epitope prediction used in vaccine development:
Due to the spread of COVID-19, vaccine development is being demanded as soon as possible. The dataset and the sample code used in this project for B-cell epitope prediction are open-source. The data was obtained from IEDB and UniProt.  

The data: Information on whether or not an amino acid peptide exhibited antibody-inducing activity (marked by an activity label) could be obtained from IEDB, which was used in many previous studies. Accordingly, this information was used as the label data. We also obtained the epitope candidate amino acid sequences (peptides) and the activity label data from the B-cell epitope data provided in IEDB. The presented antibody proteins were restricted to IgG, which constituted the most recorded type in IEDB. For convenience, we excluded records representing different quantitative measures of antibody activity for the same peptide from experiments. The epitope data obtained from IEDB corresponded to the five types of activity: "Positive-High," "Positive-Intermediate," "Positive-Low," "Positive," and "Negative." However, due to the limited number of data elements marked with the "Positive-High," "Positive-Intermediate," and "Positive-Low" labels, we equally considered these labels as "Positive", thereby attributing the task to a binary estimation.
